# Content Management System MICA
A Dynamic Web Tool using Java Servlets to convert a JSON file
into a website for the Media Informatics and Content Analysis
research lab at the University of Southern  California

 - Has the capability to generate the website either by parsing
 the JSON on every load of the website (currently active) or
 generate a serialized file with the JSON already parsed and read from
 that file on every load.

 - For iframe demos, the iframe key is the url to be used in the src
 value in the html
 - to adjust the size or any styling of the iframe (or any html of
   that project's page) make the demo of type 'script_iframe'
 - in a script or script_iframe demo, the script value will be
   the src value for a script tag. Use the id in jquery or javascript
   in the file that the src link points to to modify the html.
